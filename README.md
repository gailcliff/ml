SUPERVISED LEARNING
Give your algorithms inputs and correct outputs for those inputs (examples), train it to predict reasonable outputs given its learnings from the input/output examples it got, even if it's given inputs that were not in its training set.

Examples of supervised learning: regression and classification.

The main difference between regression and classification lies in the type of output they predict. Regression algorithms are used to predict continuous values like price, salary, or age, while classification algorithms are used to predict discrete values such as gender, spam detection, or true/false outcomes.

Regression finds correlations between dependent and independent variables to predict continuous variables.
Example: Weather forecasting where past data is used to predict future weather conditions.
Types of Regression Algorithms: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, etc.

Classification algorithms divide datasets into discrete classes based on various parameters to predict discrete outcomes.
Example: Email spam detection where emails are categorized as spam or not based on training data.
Types of Classification Algorithms: Decision Tree Classification, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest Classification, Support Vector Machines.

In summary, regression predicts continuous values while classification predicts discrete outcomes based on different machine learning problems and datasets.

UNSUPERVISED LEARNING
Unsupervised learning in machine learning is a technique where algorithms analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets to identify patterns and information without human intervention.

In unsupervised learning, data only comes with inputs x, but no output labels y. Algorithm has to find structure in the data.

-- Types of Unsupervised learning --
1. Clustering
2. Anomaly detection
3. Dimensionality reduction - compress data using fewer numbers
